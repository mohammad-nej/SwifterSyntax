#  Swifter Sytntax


This is an abstraction over SwiftSyntax library which makes it easy to gather information about your swift code.
Even though it doesn't support entire Swift grammar but it supports most common grammars including : 

- Variable Definition
- struct / class / actor definition
- limited type inference

#Overview
 In order to use this package all you need to do is to pass your swift code to parse your code using `SyntaxParser` object.
